Scania Trucks APS Failure Detection
This project focuses on detecting failures in the Air Pressure System (APS) of Scania trucks using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict potential APS failures before they occur, helping reduce maintenance costs and increase vehicle uptime.

*📊 Dataset*
Name: APS Failure at Scania Trucks

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Description: The dataset contains sensor data from Scania trucks. It includes multiple features representing sensor readings and a target variable indicating whether a failure occurred.

*📁 Files*
SoftComputing_Project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and model implementation.

⚙️ Project Workflow
Data Cleaning

Handling missing values and formatting.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding feature distributions and class imbalance.

Feature Engineering

Optional steps like scaling or selecting relevant features.

Modeling

Applying and comparing machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)

Evaluation

Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
